# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# Create admin and user

pw_123 = "123123123"
User.create(email: "admin@qna.dev", password: pw_123, password_confirmation: pw_123, admin: true)

["user@qna.dev", "another_user@qna.dev"].each do |e_mail|
  User.create(email: e_mail, password: pw_123, password_confirmation: pw_123, admin: false)
end

# # Test questions

# 10.times do |q|
